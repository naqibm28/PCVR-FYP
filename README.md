# PCVR-FYP
Learn how to build a PC in an engaging way!

A 3D Virtual Reality (VR) training simulator that teaches users how to build their own Personal Computer (PC) with hand gesture recognition.
Made with Unity. Requires a VR headset to play (Meta Quest 3 or equivalent recommended).

In this simulator, users will get to know the parts that go into the PC and how they work.
Then, they will be guided as they assemble the parts step-by-step until the PC is fully assembled.
This simulation acts as a fun, engaging way to introduce those wanting to know about PCs or would like to build one in the near future.
